The goal of this work is to provide a gemetric and semantic traversability map from a stereo image pairs. 


A number of works have been performed. Fankhuser have built a geometric traversability estimation that levereages 
the slope: meaning the angle of the obstacles surfaces normal and the roughness: 
meaning the difference between the elvation estimation and the smoothed elevation estimation (reference fankhauser) \cite{GhaffariJadidi2018a}.

There are different ways to map the information contained in images to the map. Different approaches (cite all ) use a
 pointcloud extracted from a depth map. This method allows to contain solely range information but also to provide more 
 channels to each point which results into a multichannel pointcloud. 
Various approaches have been used to infer the semantic information into the map.
